# Yelp_Camp_Web
This is a carefully designed website using HTML and NodeJS, with clear and responsive user interface. The purpose of this website is to provide users with detailed information of campgrounds including pictures, address and price. Users, logged in, are able to add new campgrounds posts, edit campgrounds posts, comment on posts, and edit their comments. To accomplish these behaviors, three databases were created using MongoDB to store User login data, Comment data, and Campground post data. Also, all pages are styled using CSS, and libraries from Bootstrap. Layout of index page where all the general information of campgrounds resides is changed corresponding to window size.
